## Quarter 2 Project Proposal Questions
*1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?*
I really enjoy learning about Feature Learning in Neural Networks (NNs). It's amazing how good NNs are at a variety of tasks and yet we are only beginning to understand what makes them perform so well. It's vital to understand how they perform so well not only for clarity and understanding of the models, but also to introduce feature learning to tradition, non-feature learning models. In a paper that Professor Belkin co-authored, they created a kernel machine that utilized a kernel that allowed for feature learning.


*2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.*
I'd love to look more into how we can utilize the feature learning techinques in other models like SVMs, trees, etc. I imagine the performance would increase and also the interpetability of the models. They might be able to perform even better on tasks that they are typicall not as good at.


*3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?*
Something interesting that Professor Belking mentioned was a single-index model. These models take in data that rely on one input feature. It was found that NNs are extremely good at determining this feature, but we don't necessarily know why. It would be interesting to know why they are so good at that and how that can help us in feature selection/cleaning for the broader landscape of Data Science.


*4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?*
I would be interested in using other types of Neural networks such as Convolutional and Transformer networks to see how the features can be extracted from those. That might be a lot harder of a task though so my group will have to discuss with our mentors how that might look and what that might entail.
